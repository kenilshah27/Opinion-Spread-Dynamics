This is also an interaction model where each of the individuals have an initial opinion of {-1,1} . A pair of neighboring agents is 
picked and if they have a similar opinion , each of their neigbour takes up that similar opinion. If they do not agree with each 
other, no changes happen in the model. This is based on the fact that if many people have a certain opinion, people tend to take up that
opinion. But if an individual has some opinion, people generally do not start taking up his/her opinion.
