This model is based on the fact that interactions takes place in a social environment and individuals opinion's are affected when they 
interact someone who has an opinion similar or dissimilar to them. What happens in this model is that when two individual interactd 
they share their opinion, if they have a similiar opinion they would have a constructive debate and both of their opinions move close 
to each other. They opinions would start coming close to each other. If they have a very dissimiliar opinion ,they would not agree with
each other and woulf return with their initial opinion without the interactions. All this parameter of dissimilarity and how much an 
opinion will be changed can be controlled depending on our requirement. The model will stop we have form distinct groups whose opinion 
do not match and hence their is no further scope of improvement in the model.
